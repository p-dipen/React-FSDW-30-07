# What is Hooks ? 
ReactJS Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, are among the most impactful updates to the library, with over 80% of modern React projects adopting them for state and lifecycle management. They let developers use state, side effects, and other React features without writing class components. Hooks streamline code, improve readability, and promote a functional programming style, making functional components as powerful—if not more—than their class-based counterparts.
