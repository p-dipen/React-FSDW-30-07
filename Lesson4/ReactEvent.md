React Event

Just Like html DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events.

React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc

Adding Events

React events are written in camelCase syntax:

`onClick` instead of `onclick`.
<button onclick="functionName()">Send</button>

In React
<button onClick={functionName()}>Send</button>
